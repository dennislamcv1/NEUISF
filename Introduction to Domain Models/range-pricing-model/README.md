# Overview
This assignment is similar to the University model assignment you just completed, but instead we will be focusing on exploring a pricing model. 

In this assignment you will be given a large model with classes and relationships. You will once again be tasked with creating instances of objects. In this case you will explore how to better organize your code using a separate `ConfigureABusiness` class.

# To Begin:
Open the project inside Visual Studio Code using the “Open Lab” button above.

# Lab Steps

**Part 1: Populating the model with the following information:**
Using the main method of the main class, you will need to create instances of objects using existing classes from the model. You will need to create the following: 
This should be implemented in `ui/RangePricingApplication.java`. Please do not change the naming conventions of any pre-provided file names, methods, or properties.

- Business - 1 Business
- Suppliers - 30 Suppliers
- Pick any 5 Suppliers and add 20 Products to each
- Customers - 30 customers
- For each Customer add 5 to 15 Orders with 1 to 5 Items to each Order

Implement any classes, methods if you need to.

**Part 2: Using the Product report as a reference guide, generate a Customer report with the following:**
This should be implemented through use of `CustomerManagement/CustomersReport.java`and `CustomerManagement/CustomersSummary.java` and `CustomerManagement/CustomerProfile.java` Please do not change the naming conventions of any pre-provided file names, methods, or properties.
- Customer’s name
- Total sales of that specific customer
- Number of orders of that customer

Implement any classes, methods if you need to.

**Part 3: For the final part of the assignment, add the following data to the report you created in Part 2:**
This should be implemented in `CustomerManagement/CustomersReport.java` and `CustomerManagement/CustomersSummary.java`. Please do not change the naming conventions of any pre-provided file names, methods, or properties.
- Total number of Items bought by specific customer
- Average amount per order
- Average amount per item

Implement any classes, methods if you need to.

# When you have finished your lab:
