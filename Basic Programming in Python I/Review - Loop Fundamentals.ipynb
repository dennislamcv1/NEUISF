    "In Python, loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a specific condition is met. There are two main types of loops in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For loop\n",
    "2. While loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Both types of loops allow you to control the flow of your program and perform repetitive tasks efficiently. It's important to ensure that the loop's condition will eventually become False to prevent infinite loops, which can hang or crash your program. Loops are fundamental constructs in programming and are used extensively to automate tasks, iterate through data, and solve various computational problems.\n",
